# View Source Location plugin for Protege

This simple Protege plugin allows to reveal the source location of the currently  active ontology.

If the ontology file is in the local file system (loaded from there or recently saved there), then the folder containing the file is opened in the system's default file browser. Otherwise, the location is opened in the system's default web browser. 

## Usage

From the File menu, select "Show file location".
